# Product-Card exercise

## Description

This project is an exploration into the Flexbox grid system.
We used Flexbox to display a collection of product cards, that give basic information about the product you are purchasing.
Any card with a product that is unavailable should have a overlayed image that says "Sold out".
Everything on this page is created with vanilla html, css, and js.
